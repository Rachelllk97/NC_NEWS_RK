We'll have two databases in this project: one for real-looking dev data, and another for simpler test data.

1. You will need to create two .env files for your project: .env.test and .env.development. 

2. Into each env. file, add PGDATABASE=, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names). 

3. Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.

4. Now, in your terminal, you'll need to run: npm install.
